  <p>Are You Your Work explores the personal relationships individuals feel to their work in a public setting. The project will debut at the <a href="http://www.openengagement.info" target="_blank">2014 Open Engagement Conference</a> taking place at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Queens+Museum/@40.745666,-73.846501,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25fd006096399:0x380dca2c1bba2e6" target="_blank">Queens Museum</a>. </p>

  <p>Influenced in equal parts by the interviews of Studs Terkel and the public projections of Jenny Holzer, Are You Your Work elevates private musings on the subject of self and work and identity into a public conversation.</p>

  <p>Are You Your Work asks participants to formulate micro essays about their convictions regarding how much their identities are tied to their work (however they define the term). The answers will be displayed inside the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Queens+Museum/@40.745666,-73.846501,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89c25fd006096399:0x380dca2c1bba2e6" target="_blank">Queens Musuem</a>, as well as being fed to a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/areyouyourwork" target="_blank">twitter</a> account, so as to be accessible to people not attending the conference and archived for future exploration.</p>
